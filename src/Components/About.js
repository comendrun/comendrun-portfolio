        <p>
          I'm a self-taught Frontend Web Developer & I enjoy learning and
          coding. I have several personal projects and mostly spend my time
          learning new technologies or developing my current stack. I strongly
          believe in my abilities and I'm eager to learn more and more every
          day.

        <p>
          After several years of experience as a Dental Technician- while I
          gained valuable skills- I'm finally about to make a big change in my
          life and change careers. It's a big step for me but a small one
          towards a new life full of programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am interested in working with teams that value Respect, humility,
          and also Collective growth & Open to remote positions, as well as
          on-site positions in München, Ingolstadt, or Nürnberg ( Germany ).
